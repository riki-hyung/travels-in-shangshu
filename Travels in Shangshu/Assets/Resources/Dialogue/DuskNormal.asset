  paragraphs:
  - Leave. I no longer care for the world around us. The mountains, rivers, flowers,
    forests, the people are too exhausting to create. Instead allow me to feel time
    pass.
  - It it unbecoming of you to stay here. If you are satisfied, you are satisfied.
    Either way dreams are unto life, when one enter this sleep, will one sleep for
    millennia?
  - To continue talking to me. I should paint you a scroll. The world I paint is
    much more fasinating than this one. How many have been lost to the embers of
    passion.
