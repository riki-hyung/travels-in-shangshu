  paragraphs:
  - I was of the mind I would finally meet someone past, an old friend. To share
    a cup or a pint with, but alas your eyes say otherwise.
  - Never did I think this is how you now present yourself. From not knowing one
    is one, isn't this like a dream?
  - Ling, you may call me. "General, I heed thy order," should I reply?  Do not take
    me seriously. I am a poet, nevermore.
  - A pity the people of now are, by and large unable to exercise patience. How our
    present scholars suffer at this change in perception. Yet I have no objections
    to today.
  - You wish for me to compose a verse? Look for me when clouds ranged as billows,
    the long road has withered, and when I depart this vista, to sail on a ferry.
  - Even the great poets of our age, has times where one is lost for words. For how
    can one think whilest drunk on reality?
