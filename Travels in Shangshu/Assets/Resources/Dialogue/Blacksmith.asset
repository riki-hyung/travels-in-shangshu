  - Heard from one of your guys that I can make a comfy living here. Huh? Where's
    my tools? Don't have them.
  - Why? Ugh, there's that lame look on your face. I don't care for boring ass work,
    and honestly I rather go shopping than make you a new weapon. You should be able
    to change it by right-clicking or something like that.
  - You're not strong enough to even stand against me. My weaponry can easily cleave
    your body and your soul apart.
  - I'm working on redocorating the place, so don't jump around like an child.
  - Still talking to me? How annoying, you casters don't understand the importance
    of weapons for society.
  - Why do I got to waste my time talking to a third rate amateur? Ugh, anyways I'm
    not teaching or giving you anything. These things are only useful to people who
    value them.
  - It feels so weird to NOT carry a weapon around. So it goes, I guess. I could
    be using your body as an anvil for my hammer, but you hold nothing but empty
    dreams and false wishes. A waste of my talents.
